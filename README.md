# RAMROD generator

For generating english 10-character-words with no repeated characters.

## What is RAMROD?

RAMROD is an old-school, superceded method for IFF in military aviation. Read about it [here](http://lafayette24sqn.free.fr/2013TLW/DOCumentation_files/2013%2006%2020%20SPINS%20TLW%202013%20CH1.pdf). The reason for the 10 character length is that the RAMROD word can also be used to encrypt digits 0-9, for example GPS coordinates.
